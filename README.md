# react-basics
The beginning of my ReactJS journey.

## Synopsis
A very simple page, where the square color changes when you click it. It toggles between two colors.

## Motivation
The reason this repository exists is because I want to learn ReactJS. I know it is such a popular framework nowadays. I'm very excited to learn more ReactJS and this little project was a good way for me to start.
